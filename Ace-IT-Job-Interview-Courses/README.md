YouTube provides two types of URLs for channels: the channel ID URL and the custom handle URL.

1. **Channel ID URL**: This is the default URL assigned to every YouTube channel and includes a unique string of characters. It's typically used when the channel is first created.
   - Example: `https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPQaJmElLBya7vliMk1E1Sg`

2. **Custom Handle URL**: YouTube recently introduced custom handles, allowing creators to have a more personalized and easily recognizable URL. This is similar to a username and is easier for your audience to remember and share.
   - Example: `https://www.youtube.com/@AceITJobInterviewCourses-ok4gn`

Both URLs will direct viewers to your channel, but the custom handle URL is generally more user-friendly and professional.

## How to Use These URLs

- **Promoting Your Channel**: Use the custom handle URL (`https://www.youtube.com/@AceITJobInterviewCourses-ok4gn`) in your marketing materials, social media profiles, and anywhere else you want to direct people to your channel. It’s easier to remember and share.
- **Linking Within YouTube**: The channel ID URL can be useful for specific YouTube features or integrations that require it, but for most practical purposes, the custom handle URL is preferable.

## Consistency

To ensure consistency and ease of access, always promote your custom handle URL to your audience. This helps in building a strong and recognizable brand presence.
